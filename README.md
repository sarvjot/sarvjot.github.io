<a href="https://sarvjot.github.io/"> My portfolio Website </a> 
=============================


This is static website hosted on github pages. However, I tried to make it interactive by adding customisable options for font-style and theme. This was done by the use of CSS variables. The website is fully responsive, with support for mobile as well as tablets. 

Special attention was given to navigation between different sections of the portfolio, this was done with a library called jump.js for implementing the smooth scroll effect. Furthermore, different parts of portfolio required the functionality of an image gallery, the same was implemented by the use of Magnific-Popup.js . Finally there is a CP section which initially lists my cf-stats and can be used to fetch user's own cf-stats, ofc created using cf-api. The code for this website is public at github, the link for which is given in the portfolio itself(under the projects section). Any suggestion or pull request is welcome! Thanks for your valuable time.
